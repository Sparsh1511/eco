              >In the present study, we used the satellite imageries derived
              through remote sensing for acquiring temporal LULC information of
              Delhi and ESs value coefficients (VCs) of the proximate biomes
              proposed by Costanza et al. The LULC datasets act as proxy
              measures in valuation of ESs at local or regional level, as
              confirmed by many studie. Though there are arguments from many
              researchers and economists against the utilization of global VC of
              Costanza et al. for regional value quantification, yet their
              valuation scheme standalone in this modest field of ESs studies
              with a comprehensive set of VCs for a range of ecosystem types and
              their respective ecosystem functions . Moreover, this ESs
              valuation approach assumes spatial homogeneity of services within
              the ecosystems (i.e., LULC types), both at time-series and
              cross-sectional analysis. For instance, either the polluted or
              non-polluted sites of the Yamuna river received a similar
              estimation, although their ESV could greatly vary, for example in
              regard of the water provisioning or water regulating service.
              Similarly, the northern tropical thorn forests located on steep
              slopes of Aravali range viz. Asola wildlife sanctuary and the
              relatively flatter area of Central ridge forests too received
              similar estimation for example in case of protection against soil
              erosion. These signify that the used ES value coefficients do,
              yet, not consider the impact of environmental quality of a
              particular LULC type, which impacts many key ecosystem functions
              of urban landscapes like water regulation, flood regulation, soil
              erosion etc. Indeed, such factors also play a key role and should
              be taken into account in the future development of ecosystem value
              coefficient either with global or regional perspective. This need
              to be increasingly studied in future research initiatives as it
              will extend our understandings of the spatial heterogeneous
              characteristics of ESVs with changing environmental conditions.

              the process of urban growth in Delhi as well. The quantitative
              results of our study showed the role of LULC dynamics in declining
              the ESV of the city landscape over the course of urbanization.
              Specifically, our study showed that the fluctuations in estimated
              TESV are a function of the interaction of all changes over the
              landscape. For instance, though the urbanized area was ~25% high
              in 2003 from 1998, yet TESV was higher for 2003 (+US$ 1.40
              million) due to increased forest cover by 5422.68 ha and hence the
              associated supporting services. Our studies have mirrored the
              research findings of Wang et al. showing an attributable increase
              (by US $ 15.86 million) in the provision of ESs with a respective
              increase in forest LULC type in Ningxia of China as a result of
              forest restoration efforts. Findings from other studies also
              showed how such urban expansions along with a concomitant increase
              in LULC types holds the capacity to deliver a higher level of ESs,
              and may not lead to a net decline in TESV.

              >Similarly, in the second period (2003–2011), our study observed a
              decline in the ESV for the forest and waterbody LULC types while a
              key increase in ESV (by US $ 1.41 million) for plantation class
              which was a result of ‘plant a million trees’ – a drive-by
              Government of Delhi incorporating community participation at
              various scales, hence helped in elevating plantation area of the
              city by 89% in 2011 relative to 1998. But overall, expansion of
              urban and suburban land use holds a greater potential of declining
              the ESs. During the study period, the annual ESs of Delhi were
              dropped from US$ 30.96 million to US$ 23.52 million. The spatially
              homogeneous per hectare loss was of 24.59% (US$
              5134.5 ha−1 year−1). The most attributable reason for this decline
              is the resultant shift in LULC of forest and cropland into a
              continuous spread of the built-up area, as also seen in other
              studies.

              ESs due to increased forest cover along the Yamuna channels. The

              attributable reason for this loss (US$ 3.53 million)
              is deforestation at the altar of development activities and
              encroachments. The withdrawal of Section 81 of Delhi Land Reforms

              of habitat for biodiversity but also assist in enhancement and

              Work Development (in case of Sundar nursery) in maintenance,
              protection and enhancement of city ESs. Second, engaging urban
              residents, developing a deeper understanding of ESs and their
              importance to achieve socio-economic goals along with conservation
              requires raised awareness and participation of urban residents.
              For example, the plantation drive - ‘plant a million trees’ helped
              in net gain of ESs of worth US $ 1.41 million with community
              participation. Engaging the urban residents with raised awareness
              about the societal benefits from ESs can aid in promoting public
              support in ESs conservation and enhancement .

              >In the near future, it is projected that India will be number one
              accommodator of urbanites by adding 404 million new urban
              dwellers. The present scale and process of urbanization in India
              ensures a greater consequence to the ecosystem functions and
              processes. As rapidly growing cities tend not to sustain their
              growth, it is necessary to study and highlight the importance of
              ESs in sustaining human well-being by delivering both indirect and
              direct beneficial services. Such studies can be utilized as a
              powerful means to compare while highlighting the change in ESs
              with paced up urbanization. And last but not the least, such
              quantitative evaluations provide detailed information regarding
              the economic evidence of threats borne by natural ecosystems due
              to extra-ordinarily rising demand of humans and hence can help to
              create a layman understanding. Such a study is an essential,
              simple and sailing way for communications not only to make the
              society aware but can also assist officials engaged in planning
              policies of existing as well as upcoming urban landscapes with a
              similar area. Hence the policy formulation practices using inputs
              from ESs related study could aid in protecting the natural assets
              rather than dissipating them.
